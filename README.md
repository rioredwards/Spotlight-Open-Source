# Spotlight Open Source & Using Documentation

## Getting Started

Use [this](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/react-spotlight-open-source) template to get started with this deliverable.

## Description

The purpose of this week's spotlight is to introduce you to using open-source libraries. In this lesson we'll learn how to assess open-source projects for use in your application and how to use documentation and quick-start guides to get a quick sense of how to use the library and whether or not it is appropriate for your project.

### Table Libraries

- [R-Suite Tables](https://github.com/rsuite/rsuite-table)
- [React Bootstrap Table](https://react-bootstrap-table.github.io/react-bootstrap-table2/)
- [React Base Table](https://github.com/Autodesk/react-base-table)

### Chart Libraries

- [Victory Chart](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/)
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/)
- [Charts.js](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2)

### Component/CSS Libraries

- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) (not a component library -- just CSS)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Acceptance Criteria

- One chart displaying at the `/charts` route
- User data displayed at the `/tables` route
- A CSS library layout and / or custom components implemented
- A reflection of the process -- please write at least one paragraph reflecting on implementing open-source libaries in your app. Was it easier or harder than you expected? Did it take you a few attempts to find the right library? Did anything surprise you?
